//! An implementation of the MPQ file format, for the features used by SCM/SCX files in StarCraft.
//! All features that are not used by the game are not implemented, and the implementation matches
//! the game's behavior as closely as possible (including bugs, which are often exploited by
//! so-called "map protectors" to prevent 3rd party editors from opening map files).
