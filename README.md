# broodmap

A pure Rust implementation of StarCraft 1 map parsing. This library works for both SCM and SCX
files, and offers handling for the archive format (MPQ) as well as the internal scenario description
(CHK).

## WIP

This library is a work-in-progress, it is not yet complete or ready for use.
